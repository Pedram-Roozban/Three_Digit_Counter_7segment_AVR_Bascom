# Three_Digit_Counter_7segment_AVR_Bascom
Three digit counter (0-999) in Proteus coded in AVR Bascom.

We used following things in this project:

An Atmega 16.
Three 7-segments as our dices.
One key for starting the counter.

For using this project you just simply need to do following things:

Open Proteus softeware(Run as admindinistrator) and then open The Three_Digit_Counter_7segment_Circuit_Design.pdsprj file with it.
Right click on Atmega 16 and then click on "Edit properties" or just simply Double click on Atmega 16.
Give it the .obj or .hex porgram files.
Set CKSEL Fuses to Int.Rc 8MHz.
Click Ok.
Start the simulation by clicking on the  Play icon which is on the buttom left corner.
You can also edit the program file by opeing the Three_Digit_Counter_7segment_Code.bas with BASCOM - AVR
